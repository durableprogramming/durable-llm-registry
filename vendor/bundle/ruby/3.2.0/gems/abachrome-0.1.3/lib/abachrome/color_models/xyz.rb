# Abachrome::ColorModels::Xyz - XYZ color space model definition
#
# This module defines the XYZ color model within the Abachrome color manipulation library.
# XYZ is the CIE 1931 color space that forms the basis for most other color space definitions
# and serves as a device-independent reference color space. The XYZ color space represents
# colors using tristimulus values that correspond to the response of the human visual system
# to light stimuli, making it fundamental to color science and accurate color reproduction.
#
# Key features:
# - Registers the XYZ color space with coordinate names [x, y, z]
# - Represents tristimulus values for device-independent color specification
# - Serves as intermediate color space for conversions between different color models
# - Uses normalized values for consistency with other color models in the library
# - Maintains high precision through AbcDecimal arithmetic for color transformations
# - Provides validation for XYZ coordinate ranges to ensure valid color representations
#
# The XYZ model is particularly important in the color science pipeline as it provides
# a standardized reference for color matching and serves as the foundation for defining
# other color spaces like LAB, making it essential for accurate color transformations
# that maintain consistency across different devices and viewing conditions.
