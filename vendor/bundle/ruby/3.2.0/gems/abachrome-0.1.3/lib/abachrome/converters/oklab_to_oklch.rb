# Abachrome::Converters::OklabToOklch - OKLAB to OKLCH color space converter
#
# This converter transforms colors from the OKLAB color space to the OKLCH color space
# using cylindrical coordinate conversion. The transformation converts the rectangular
# coordinates (L, a, b) to cylindrical coordinates (L, C, h) where lightness remains
# unchanged, chroma is calculated as the Euclidean distance in the a-b plane, and hue
# is calculated as the angle in the a-b plane expressed in degrees.
#
# Key features:
# - Converts OKLAB rectangular coordinates to OKLCH cylindrical coordinates
# - Preserves lightness component unchanged during conversion
# - Calculates chroma as sqrt(a² + b²) for colorfulness representation
# - Computes hue angle using atan2 function and normalizes to 0-360 degree range
# - Maintains alpha channel transparency values during conversion
# - Uses AbcDecimal arithmetic for precise color science calculations
# - Validates input color space to ensure proper OKLAB source data
#
# The OKLCH color space provides an intuitive interface for color manipulation through
# its cylindrical coordinate system, making it ideal for hue adjustments, saturation
# modifications, and other color operations that benefit from polar coordinates.
