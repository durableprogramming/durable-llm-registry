# Abachrome::Converters::SrgbToOklch - sRGB to OKLCH color space converter
#
# This converter transforms colors from the standard RGB (sRGB) color space to the OKLCH color space
# through a two-step conversion process. The transformation first converts sRGB gamma-corrected
# values to OKLAB rectangular coordinates as an intermediate step, then applies cylindrical coordinate
# conversion to produce the final OKLCH values with lightness, chroma, and hue components.
#
# Key features:
# - Two-stage conversion pipeline: sRGB → OKLAB → OKLCH
# - Leverages existing SrgbToOklab and OklabToOklch converters for modular transformation
# - Converts display-ready RGB values to perceptually uniform cylindrical coordinates
# - Maintains alpha channel transparency values during conversion
# - Uses AbcDecimal arithmetic for precise color science calculations
# - Validates input color space to ensure proper sRGB source data
#
# The OKLCH color space provides an intuitive interface for color manipulation through its
# cylindrical coordinate system, making it ideal for hue adjustments, saturation modifications,
# and other color operations that benefit from polar coordinates while maintaining perceptual
# uniformity for natural-looking color transformations.
