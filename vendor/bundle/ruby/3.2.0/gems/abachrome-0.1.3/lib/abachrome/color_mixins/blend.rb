# Abachrome::ColorMixins::Blend - Color blending and mixing functionality
#
# This mixin provides methods for blending and mixing colors together in various color spaces.
# The blend operation interpolates between two colors by a specified amount, creating smooth
# color transitions. All blending operations preserve alpha values and can be performed in
# the current color space or a specified target color space for optimal results.
#
# Key features:
# - Linear interpolation between colors with configurable blend amounts
# - Support for blending in different color spaces (sRGB, OKLAB, OKLCH)
# - Both non-destructive (blend/mix) and destructive (blend!/mix!) variants
# - Automatic color space conversion when blending colors from different spaces
# - High-precision decimal arithmetic for accurate color calculations
#
# The mixin includes both immutable methods that return new color instances and mutable
# methods that modify the current color object in place, providing flexibility for
# different use cases and performance requirements.

      # @method blend
      # Interpolates between two colors, creating a new color that is a blend of the two.
      # The blend happens in the specified color space or the current color space if none is provided.
      # #
      # @param [Abachrome::Color] other The color to blend with
      # @param [Float, Integer, #to_d] amount The blend amount between 0 and 1, where 0 returns the original color and 1 returns the other color. Defaults to 0.5 (midpoint)
      # @param [Symbol, nil] target_color_space The color space to perform the blend in (optional)
      # @return [Abachrome::Color] A new color representing the blend of the two colors
      # @example Blend two colors equally
      #   red.blend(blue, 0.5)
      # @example Blend with 25% of another color
      #   red.blend(blue, 0.25)
      # @example Blend in a specific color space
      #   red.blend(blue, 0.5, target_color_space: :oklab)
