# Abachrome::ColorMixins::ToOklch - OKLCH color space conversion functionality
#
# This mixin provides methods for converting colors to the OKLCH color space, which is a
# cylindrical representation of the OKLAB color space using lightness, chroma, and hue
# coordinates. OKLCH offers intuitive color manipulation through its polar coordinate
# system where hue is represented as an angle and chroma represents colorfulness.
#
# Key features:
# - Convert colors to OKLCH with automatic converter lookup
# - Both non-destructive (to_oklch) and destructive (to_oklch!) conversion methods
# - Direct access to OKLCH components (lightness, chroma, hue)
# - Utility methods for OKLCH array and value extraction
# - Optimized to return the same object when no conversion is needed
# - High-precision decimal arithmetic for accurate color science calculations
#
# The OKLCH color space uses three components: L (lightness), C (chroma/colorfulness),
# and h (hue angle in degrees), providing an intuitive interface for color adjustments
# that better matches human perception compared to traditional RGB-based color spaces.

      # first converts to OKLAB as an intermediate step, then converts to OKLCH.
