# Abachrome::ColorMixins::ToOklab - OKLAB color space conversion functionality
#
# This mixin provides methods for converting colors to the OKLAB color space, which is a
# perceptually uniform color space designed for better color manipulation and comparison.
# OKLAB provides more intuitive lightness adjustments and color blending compared to
# traditional RGB color spaces, making it ideal for color science applications.
#
# Key features:
# - Convert colors to OKLAB with automatic converter lookup
# - Both non-destructive (to_oklab) and destructive (to_oklab!) conversion methods
# - Direct access to OKLAB components (lightness, a, b)
# - Utility methods for OKLAB array and value extraction
# - Optimized to return the same object when no conversion is needed
# - High-precision decimal arithmetic for accurate color science calculations
#
# The OKLAB color space uses three components: L (lightness), a (green-red axis), and
# b (blue-yellow axis), providing a more perceptually uniform representation of colors
# that better matches human visual perception compared to traditional color spaces.
