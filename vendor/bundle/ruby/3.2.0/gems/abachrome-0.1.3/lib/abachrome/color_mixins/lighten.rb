# Abachrome::ColorMixins::Lighten - Color lightness adjustment functionality
#
# This mixin provides methods for adjusting the lightness of colors by manipulating
# the L (lightness) component in the OKLAB color space. The OKLAB color space is used
# because it provides perceptually uniform lightness adjustments that appear more
# natural to the human eye compared to adjustments in other color spaces.
#
# Key features:
# - Lighten and darken colors with configurable amounts
# - Both non-destructive (lighten/darken) and destructive (lighten!/darken!) variants
# - Automatic clamping to valid lightness ranges [0, 1]
# - High-precision decimal arithmetic for accurate color calculations
# - Conversion to OKLAB color space for perceptually uniform adjustments
#
# The mixin includes both immutable methods that return new color instances and mutable
# methods that modify the current color object in place, providing flexibility for
# different use cases and performance requirements.

      # Increases the lightness of a color by the specified amount in the OKLab color space.
      # This method works by extracting the L (lightness) component from the OKLab
      # representation of the color and increasing it by the given amount, ensuring
      # the result stays within the valid range of [0, 1].
      # 
      # @param amount [Numeric] The amount to increase the lightness by, as a decimal
      # value between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.1 (10% increase).
      # @return [Abachrome::Color] A new Color instance with increased lightness.
