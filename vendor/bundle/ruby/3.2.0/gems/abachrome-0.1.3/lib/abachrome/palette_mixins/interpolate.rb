# Abachrome::PaletteMixins::Interpolate - Color palette interpolation functionality
#
# This mixin provides methods for interpolating between adjacent colors in a palette to create
# smooth color transitions and gradients. The interpolation process inserts new colors between
# existing palette colors by blending them at calculated intervals, creating smoother color
# progressions ideal for gradients, color ramps, and visual transitions.
#
# Key features:
# - Insert specified number of interpolated colors between each adjacent color pair
# - Both non-destructive (interpolate) and destructive (interpolate!) variants
# - Uses color blending in the current color space for smooth transitions
# - Maintains original colors as anchor points in the interpolated result
# - High-precision decimal arithmetic for accurate color calculations
# - Preserves alpha values during interpolation process
#
# The mixin includes both immutable methods that return new palette instances and mutable
# methods that modify the current palette object in place, providing flexibility for
# different use cases and performance requirements. Interpolation is essential for creating
# smooth color gradients and ensuring adequate color resolution in palette-based applications.
