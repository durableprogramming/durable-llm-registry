# Initial Security Assessment for Abachrome

## Assessment Date
2025-10-12

## Scope
This assessment covers the Abachrome Ruby gem, focusing on color manipulation and conversion functionality.

## Findings

### Positive Security Aspects
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure Ruby implementation with minimal dependencies
- **Immutable Objects**: Color objects are immutable, preventing accidental modification
- **Input Validation**: All parsing operations include validation
- **No Network Operations**: All computations are local
- **No File System Access**: No reading/writing of files
- **No System Calls**: Pure mathematical computations

### Potential Risks
- **Parsing Complex Inputs**: CSS color parsing could be vulnerable to malformed input
- **BigDecimal Precision**: High precision could lead to DoS via very large numbers
- **Memory Usage**: Large color palettes could consume significant memory

### Recommendations
1. Implement input length limits for parsing operations
2. Add timeout protections for complex computations
3. Validate coordinate ranges strictly
4. Consider rate limiting for palette operations
5. Regular dependency updates and security scans

## Threat Model

### Actors
- **Users**: Developers using the gem
- **Attackers**: Malicious users attempting to exploit parsing or computation

### Assets
- System resources (CPU, memory)
- User data integrity

### Threats
- DoS via computationally expensive inputs
- Memory exhaustion via large data structures
- Parsing exploits in CSS color functions

### Mitigations
- Input sanitization and validation
- Reasonable limits on data sizes
- Immutable data structures
- Pure functional operations where possible

## Conclusion
The gem has a strong security posture due to its pure computational nature and lack of external interfaces. Focus should be on input validation and resource limits for production use.
